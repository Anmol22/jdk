// VirtualMemoryTracker (VMT) is the internal class of NMT that only the MemTracker class uses it for performing the NMT operations.
// All the Hotspot code use only the MemTracker interface to register the memory operations in NMT.
// Memory regions can be reserved/committed/uncommitted/released by calling MemTracker API which in turn call the corresponding functions in VMT.
// VMT uses RegionsTree to hold and manage the memory regions. Each region has two nodes that each one has address of the region (start/end) and
// state (reserved/released/committed) and MemTag of the regions before and after it.
//
// The memory operations of Reserve/Commit/Uncommit/Release (RCUR) are tracked by updating/inserting/deleting the nodes in the tree. When an operation
// changes nodes in the tree, the summary of the changes is returned back in a SummaryDiff struct. This struct shows that how much reserve/commit amount
// of any specific MemTag is changed. The summary of every operation is accumulated in VirtualMemorySummary class.
//
// Not all operations are valid in VMT. The following predicates are checked before the operation is applied to the tree nad/or VirtualMemorySummary:
//   - committed size of a MemTag should be <= of its reserved size
//   - uncommitted size of a MemTag should be <= of its committed size
//   - released size of a MemTag should be <= of its reserved size
